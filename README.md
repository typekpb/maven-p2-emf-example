maven-p2-emf-example
====================

shows how to install emf dependencies from p2 into local mvn repo

the emf submodule collects p2 dependencies into a single jar.
the parent pom allows this jar to be resolved as a dependency.

if someone has an idea how to get the sources from p2 bundled with that: PLEASE let me know.
